    <p>Japanese culture is a blend of ancient traditions and modern influences. Rooted in Shinto and Buddhism, 
        it emphasizes harmony with nature, simplicity, and imperfection, seen in practices like tea ceremonies
         and ikebana (flower arranging). Japanâ€™s architecture, such as Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, reflects 
         this connection to nature and minimalism.</p>
    <p>Modern Japan is known for its technological innovation and global pop culture, particularly anime, 
        manga, and J-pop, while maintaining traditional aspects. The country has successfully balanced modernization 
        with heritage, keeping its culture alive through both contemporary and ancient forms of expression.</p>
    <p>Socially, Japan values respect, harmony, and group cohesion. Customs like bowing and gift-giving are important, 
        reflecting the country's deep-rooted sense of etiquette. Traditional practices, including sumo wrestling and 
        festivals like Hanami, remain significant in everyday life.</p>
