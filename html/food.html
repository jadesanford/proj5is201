    <p>Japanese food culture focuses on simplicity, balance, and seasonal ingredients, with rice as the staple and dishes
         like sushi, sashimi, and tempura. Meals are often smaller and presented with attention to texture and color, 
         reflecting the seasons. Eating is an experience, emphasizing respect for the food.</p>
    <p>In contrast, American food culture prioritizes convenience and larger portions, with a wider range of global
        influences. While Japan uses chopsticks, America typically uses forks and knives. Japanese meals are more 
        ritualistic and focused on appreciation, while American dining is often casual and multitasked.</p>
